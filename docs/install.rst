Installation guide
==================

CASCADE is implemented in the ``cascade-reg`` package. It can be installed
directly using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install cascade-reg

.. tip::
    To avoid potential dependency conflicts, installing within a
    `conda environment <https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html>`__
    is recommended.

A conda build will be available in the future.

Now you are all set. Proceed to `tutorials <tutorials.rst>`__ for how to use the
``cascade-reg`` package.
